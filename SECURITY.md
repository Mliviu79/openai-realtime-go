# Security Advisory

## Overview
This document outlines known security vulnerabilities in the OpenAI Realtime Go library and provides guidance for maintaining security.

## Current Vulnerability Status (as of v0.1.4)

### ðŸš¨ Active Vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability #1: GO-2025-3563 (HTTP Request Smuggling)
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Component:** Go Standard Library (net/http)
- **Current Version:** go1.23.5
- **Fixed In:** go1.23.8
- **CVE:** [GO-2025-3563](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3563)

**Description:**
Request smuggling vulnerability due to acceptance of invalid chunked data in net/http.

**Affected Code:**
- File: `httpClient/client.go:48:25`
- Function: `processResponse[CreateTranscriptionSessionResponse]`
- Impact: HTTP client operations may be vulnerable to request smuggling attacks

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Impact:** HIGH - Could allow attackers to smuggle malicious requests
- **Likelihood:** MEDIUM - Requires specific attack vectors
- **Overall Risk:** HIGH

#### Vulnerability #2: GO-2025-3447 (Timing Sidechannel)
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Component:** Go Standard Library (crypto/internal/nistec)
- **Current Version:** go1.23.5
- **Fixed In:** go1.23.6
- **Platform:** ppc64le only
- **CVE:** [GO-2025-3447](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3447)

**Description:**
Timing sidechannel for P-256 elliptic curve operations on ppc64le architecture.

**Affected Code:**
- File: `ws/gorilla.go:63:39`
- Function: `GorillaWebSocketDialer.Dial`
- Impact: WebSocket TLS connections using P-256 curves

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - Could leak cryptographic information
- **Likelihood:** LOW - Limited to ppc64le architecture and requires sophisticated attacks
- **Overall Risk:** LOW-MEDIUM

## Mitigation Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Update Go Version (CRITICAL)**
   ```bash
   # Check current version
   go version
   
   # Download and install Go 1.23.8 or later from https://golang.org/dl/
   # For Windows: Download the MSI installer for go1.23.8 or later
   ```

2. **Verify Update**
   ```bash
   go version  # Should show go1.23.8 or later
   govulncheck ./...  # Should show no vulnerabilities
   ```

3. **Rebuild Application**
   ```bash
   go clean -cache
   go mod tidy
   go build ./...
   ```

### Windows Go Update Instructions

1. **Download Latest Go:**
   - Visit: https://golang.org/dl/
   - Download the Windows MSI installer for Go 1.23.8+
   - Example: `go1.23.8.windows-amd64.msi`

2. **Install Process:**
   - Run the MSI installer as Administrator
   - Follow installation wizard
   - Installer will automatically update PATH

3. **Verify Installation:**
   ```powershell
   # Restart PowerShell session
   go version
   # Should output: go version go1.23.8 windows/amd64 (or later)
   ```

## Dependency Security Status

### âœ… Clean Dependencies (No Known Vulnerabilities)
- `github.com/gorilla/websocket@v1.5.3`
- `github.com/mattn/go-colorable@v0.1.13`
- `github.com/mattn/go-isatty@v0.0.20`
- `github.com/rs/zerolog@v1.33.0`

## Security Best Practices

### Regular Vulnerability Scanning
```bash
# Run before each release
govulncheck ./...

# Run detailed scan
govulncheck -show verbose ./...
```

### Dependency Management
```bash
# Keep dependencies updated
go get -u ./...
go mod tidy

# Audit dependencies
go list -m all
```

### Development Guidelines

1. **Security Review Process:**
   - Run `govulncheck` before committing code changes
   - Review security implications of new dependencies
   - Update Go version regularly (at least monthly)

2. **CI/CD Integration:**
   - Add `govulncheck` to CI pipeline
   - Fail builds on HIGH severity vulnerabilities
   - Monitor for new CVEs affecting dependencies

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Subscribe to Go security announcements
   - Monitor GitHub security advisories
   - Regular dependency audits

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in this library:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to: [security email - to be configured]
3. Include detailed reproduction steps
4. Allow reasonable time for investigation and patching

## Security Release Process

1. Security patches will be released as patch versions (e.g., v0.1.5)
2. Critical vulnerabilities will trigger immediate releases
3. Security advisories will be published with release notes
4. Affected versions will be clearly documented

## Compliance and Standards

This library aims to comply with:
- OWASP Top 10 security guidelines
- Go security best practices
- Industry standard vulnerability disclosure timelines
